# Launch script for scripted, intended to be uses as an 'Open With' application for gnome.
# It differs from the regular scripted script in that we assume gnome will always pass
# an absolute file reference to the file that is to be opened.

# Does the following:
# 1. locate any existing running node (big assumption that 'node app.js' is the node app we want)
# 2. Kills it
# 3. Calls 'launchnode' to start a new node
# 4. Opens a URL that loads the editor - the url encodes the file we want to edit
